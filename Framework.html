            <p class="risk"><span class="label red">Risk:</span> The agent's latency and slow throughput can negate the benefits of automation, leading to customer frustration and missed deadlines.</p>
            <p class="alternative"><span class="label green">Alternative:</span> Use a streamlined Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool for specific, low-latency tasks like data entry, or optimize the backend system integrations.</p>
