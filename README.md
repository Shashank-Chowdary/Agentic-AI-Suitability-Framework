Agentic AI Suitability Framework

This framework provides a structured approach to assessing the feasibility and risks of implementing Agentic AI solutions. By evaluating business value, technical fit, and security & governance factors, you can make informed decisions and set a clear strategy for successful deployment.
1. Business Value
Cost

Scenario: A financial firm uses an agent for high-frequency trading decisions, leading to continuous, high API usage and computational expenses.
Risk: Runaway operational costs that quickly outweigh the business value, especially in always-on or data-intensive workflows.
Alternative: Use a lightweight, rules-based system or traditional algorithmic trading models that are more cost-effective for high-volume tasks.
Mitigation: Implement cost-governance controls, such as budget caps, API call limits, and mandatory human approval for transactions above a certain threshold.
Time Efficiency

Scenario: An AI agent automates a complex customer onboarding process, but its latency in integrating with various systems causes delays and a poor user experience.
Risk: The agent's latency and slow throughput can negate the benefits of automation, leading to customer frustration and missed deadlines.
Alternative: Use a streamlined Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool for specific, low-latency tasks like data entry, or optimize the backend system integrations.
Mitigation: Optimize the agent's architecture for faster response times, and restrict its role to asynchronous tasks where latency isn't a critical factor.
Accuracy & Quality

Scenario: A medical diagnostic agent, trained on a biased dataset, provides inaccurate diagnoses, leading to incorrect treatment plans and increased liability.
Risk: Increased error rates and lack of consistency can lead to poor quality, non-compliance, and significant reputational and legal risks.
Alternative: Rely on a human-in-the-loop workflow where the AI provides a second opinion or a structured report for a human expert to review and approve.
Mitigation: Implement robust data quality gates and continuous monitoring to ensure the agent uses accurate, unbiased data. Regularly audit the agent's decisions against a benchmark for consistency.
Productivity & Scalability

Scenario: A small business uses an AI agent to handle all customer support inquiries, but the agent's limited automation coverage forces staff to handle a large volume of complex tickets.
Risk: The agent may not be scalable, as it requires human intervention for a high percentage of tasks, leading to the same productivity bottlenecks it was meant to solve.
Alternative: Use a simpler AI tool for specific, highly automatable tasks (e.g., password resets) and gradually expand its scope.
Mitigation: Increase automation coverage by continuously training the agent on new data and using feedback loops to handle a wider variety of inquiries, reducing the human workload over time.
Strategic/Opportunity Impact

Scenario: A retail company deploys an agent to recommend products, but its recommendations are generic, failing to provide a competitive edge or enable a new business model.
Risk: The agent fails to provide a competitive advantage or enable innovation, leading to a poor return on investment and a missed market opportunity.
Alternative: Focus on using a non-agentic recommendation engine that provides personalized suggestions based on structured data and customer profiles.
Mitigation: Align the agent with a core business strategy, such as enabling dynamic pricing or creating a new service line, to ensure it delivers a significant competitive advantage.
Transparency

Scenario: An AI agent denies a user's credit card application without providing a reason, leading to a customer complaint and a potential regulatory violation.
Risk: The lack of traceable reasoning can lead to customer mistrust and non-compliance with regulations that require explainable decisions.
Alternative: Use a traditional, transparent scoring model with clear, verifiable criteria for decision-making.
Mitigation: Implement decision logging and explanation layers that store the agent's reasoning steps, allowing for a human-readable justification and a clear audit trail.
Human Impact

Scenario: A funeral home uses an AI agent to handle bereavement counseling and grief support for clients, which causes emotional distress and damages the company's reputation.
Risk: The inability to replicate empathy and build trust can harm customer relationships and tarnish brand reputation, especially in sensitive situations.
Alternative: Use the AI as a support tool for human counselors, providing quick facts or preparing case summaries, while a human leads the conversation and provides emotional support.
Mitigation: Define clear boundaries for the agent, setting rules to escalate emotionally charged or sensitive topics to a human, ensuring oversight in all final communications.
2. Technical Fit
Integration Complexity

Scenario: A logistics company tries to integrate an AI agent into 15 different legacy systems for shipment tracking, customs, and invoicing.
Risk: Unstable performance and high costs due to data mismatches, delays, and complex maintenance across disparate platforms.
Alternative: Start with point-specific automation, such as an AI-assisted invoice processing tool, before attempting multi-system autonomy.
Mitigation: Adopt a modular integration strategy by connecting the agent through APIs or middleware that can be swapped without reconfiguring all legacy systems at once.
Real-time Data

Scenario: An AI agent is used to control a manufacturing robot on a high-speed assembly line, making split-second adjustments based on sensor data.
Risk: Safety hazards and production losses due to LLM-based decision-making latency, which cannot reliably process millisecond-level events.
Alternative: Use a dedicated, low-latency control system (e.g., a PLC) or an edge AI model optimized for deterministic performance.
Mitigation: Limit the agent's role to offline optimization, such as analyzing production logs to suggest efficiency improvements, rather than directly controlling real-time actions.
Autonomy & Goal-Orientation

Scenario: A rule-based agent is tasked with planning a marketing campaign, but it gets stuck because it can only follow a fixed script without adapting to new information or goals.
Risk: The system's lack of autonomy prevents it from handling dynamic or novel situations, requiring constant human intervention.
Alternative: Use a traditional AI model for a single, rule-bound task, or rely on a human to handle all multi-step planning.
Mitigation: Design the agent to be goal-driven with the ability to choose its own strategy and adapt its plan based on new information, rather than just following a predefined script.
Statefulness & Memory

Scenario: An AI customer support agent fails to recognize a returning customer, forcing the customer to repeat their past issues and preferences in every interaction.
Risk: The agent’s stateless nature and lack of memory lead to disjointed conversations, poor user experience, and a failure to build long-term relationships.
Alternative: Use a chatbot that can only remember context for a single session, or rely on a human agent to access and recall all customer history.
Mitigation: Implement durable, structured memory that allows the agent to recall a user's past actions, preferences, and long-term history to provide continuous and personalized service.
3. Security & Governance
Governance Requirements

Scenario: A startup’s sales agent autonomously emails prospects without rules on tone, frequency, or audience, accidentally spamming VIP clients with irrelevant offers.
Risk: The lack of governance allows the agent to violate company policies and ethical standards, leading to reputational damage and legal issues.
Alternative: Create a human-led approval workflow for all outbound actions until a clear governance framework is in place.
Mitigation: Implement agent policy enforcement through rules, monitoring dashboards, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints for high-impact actions.
Security Implications

Scenario: An AI agent is given broad access to a company's sensitive systems, and a malicious prompt tricks it into extracting confidential data.
Risk: The agent's access to sensitive systems creates new attack surfaces, making the organization vulnerable to data breaches and exploitation.
Alternative: Keep critical security processes manual or semi-automated with multi-factor human verification.
Mitigation: Enforce strict role-based access control, sandbox the agent to limit its access to sensitive data, and add anomaly detection to flag suspicious requests.
